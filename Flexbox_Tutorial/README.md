## Some Advanced CSS Properties used:

1. `display: flex` ðŸ‘‰ By using this in parent element, child elements automatically align like column or row with auto width and auto height.

2. `justify-content: space-evenly` ðŸ‘‰ justify-content we have for positioning along horizontal axis. We have other values for this property such as... space-around, space-between, start, center, end.

3. `align-items: center` ðŸ‘‰ to position along the vertical axis.

4. `margin-left: auto` ðŸ‘‰ This will create as much margin between itself and the next flex-item as possible.

5. `flex-direction: column` ðŸ‘‰ Using this property on div (block element) after using "display: flex" will align the items vertically.

6. `flex-wrap: wrap` ðŸ‘‰ controls whether flex-items wrap onto multiple lines or are forced onto one line.

7. `align-content: center` ðŸ‘‰ for multi-line flexible boxes. **It has no effect when items in a flex container are in a single line.** In short, it determines, spacing between lines.

8. `column-gap: 20px` and `row-gap: 10px` ðŸ‘‰ to provide a gap between 2 flex-items in a flex-container.
