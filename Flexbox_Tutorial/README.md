## Some Advanced CSS Properties used:

1. "display: flex" => By using this in parent element, child elements automatically align like column or row with auto width and auto height.

2. "justify-content: space-evenly" => justify-content we have for positioning along horizontal axis. We have other values for this property such as... space-around, space-between, start, center, end.

3. "align-items: center" => to position along the vertical axis.

4. "margin-left: auto" => This will create as much margin between itself and the next flex-item as possible.

5. "flex-direction: column" => Using this property on div (block element) after using "display: flex" will align the items vertically.

6. "flex-wrap: wrap" => controls whether flex-items wrap onto multiple lines or are forced onto one line.

7. "align-content: center" => for multi-line flexible boxes. **It has no effect when items in a flex container are in a single line.** In short, it determines, spacing between lines.

8. "column-gap: 20px" and "row-gap: 10px" => to provide a gap between 2 flex-items in a flex-container.
